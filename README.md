**gradFD** is a MATLAB/OCTAVE's class which can be used for computing the derivatives and hessians of a function using finite differences. Many schemes have been implemented. 

_Notice that the hessian computation remains incomplete and needs to be improved._

Features
------
**gradFD** is able to 

* Compute derivatives with the following schemes 
	- forward and backward finite differences of order 1 to 5 (BDx and FDx with x={1,...,5})
	- central finite differences of order 2 to 8 (CDx with x={2,4,6,8})
* Minimize the number of computations (especially the responses at the central points is done only one time)
* Use a specific stepsize in every direction
* Generate the set of sample points which can be used externally for computing responses. These responses can be loaded by the class in order to compute the gradients.

First start
------
Many example script have been proposed

* `Example_basic_gradFD.m`: basic example of a classical use of the class
* `Example_external_gradFD.m`: example of use of the external feature
* `Example_plot1D_gradFD.m`: plot derivatives compute on 1D function with the class
* `Example_plot2D_gradFD.m`: plot derivatives compute on 2D function with the class
* `Example_error_gradFD.m`: study of the error on derivatives vs the stepsize

The following picture is the result of the execution of the `Example_plot2D_gradFD.m ` script:

Use of the class
------
The class could be called using the following syntax `gradFD(typeIn,XrefIn,stepsIn,funIn)`
where

* `typeIn` is the chosen schemes (the full list of finite difference schemes is available via the execution of `gradFD` with no option or via the method `displaySchemes`).
* `XrefIn` is the array of points on which the gradient must be calculated.
* `stepsIn` is the list of stepsizes used in every direction and/or every point.
* `funIn` is the handle function (defined using @()) [optional]

If all these arguments are given to the class the gradients are calculated directly and stored in the property `GZeval`.

In the case of an external computation of the responses, the sample points can be exported usind the property `XevalG` and the responses computed externally can be loaded using the method `loadZextG` (see for instance the example `Example_external_gradFD.m`)
